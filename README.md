# Object-detection
Object Detection using Keras CNN
I had made a few changes, kindly run the code and check. You still would have to work with accuracy though:
1. Work with even deeper network, commented in code
2. Epoch are 100, which are enough, so dont exp with it
3. Use Transfer learning, create an issue if you need help, tag me @Ankuraxz
4. Use SOTA models
5. Tune Hyper params
